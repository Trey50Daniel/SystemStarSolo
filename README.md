GAME OVERVIEW
-------------------------------
System Star Solo is a challenging 2D platformer game that my group designed in my Game Design I class at Jacksonville State University. It was designed using the GameMaker game engine. Various features have been implemented in this game. This game supports both keyboard and controller inputs, and detects if a controller is plugged into the computer. There are four characters, and each one has separate abilities. The player is allowed to cycle through all four characters at any time he or she wishes. The game has levels of all difficulties, from beginner to expert level. To progress to the higher levels, the player must master the combinations of moves between the characters. Along with the functionality of the game, all of the graphics and sounds were all created by the team. 
## Installation
To install this game, just run the installation program. It will install the game on your computer and launch the game.
## Usage
Tutorials are included to help the player learn how to navigate and learn the abilities of each of the characters. Levels increase in difficulty and have added combinations of moves to reach the end of the level.
## Credits
I have to give credit to the members of my team, who all contributed to make this a great game. Their names are Andrew Blair, Amber Rampey, and Ethan Cantrell.
